# Paper Guidelines

- No hardcoded references, all `ref{}` better, `Cref{}`
- Figures, code etc caption below, tables caption top.
- Stress with `\textit{}` but donot stress everything, use sparingly.
- Learn using `\boxed{}`, `\fbox{}` and `\parbox{}`.
- Donot keep citations for the last moment.
- Donot change the emblem if the conference/journal explicitly mentions it.
- Donot paste first two paragraphs of Introduction in the abstract section of the submission site.
