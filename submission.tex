# Conference Paper 

- Whenever you are submitting a paper, register the paper early. A very important activity is for all the authors to mark their "conflict of interest". 
- As it takes some time, confirm that all the authors of the paper have received the registration mail and have marked their conflicts at least five days before the deadline. 
- If the conflicts are not marked by all authors correctly, the paper may have to be withdrawn. 
- Further, ensure that the set of authors and the ordering of authors is correct during registration---most conferences do not allow any change to the author-list later.
